In this addon I will try to add all custom landscapes for RHS navigators.

Maps supports:
• Chernarus
• Gogland


An unsuccessful attempt to add an island.
• Khan Thung

----

ATTENTION THESE ISLANDS WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMPONENT IN THE WORLD.
The author must use MapEntity in their world for support GPS.
Example: MapEntity_Arland.et 
Example: MapEntity_Everon.et
